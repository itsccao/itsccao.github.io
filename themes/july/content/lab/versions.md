## 6.0 (current version):
Release date: July 2025.
- A theme not based on any other theme, I made it from scratch.
- I named it **July** based on the month I made it.
- The goal of this theme is to be a simple & minimal theme with a modern look.

## 5.0:
Release date: April 2025.
- A theme based on [rissoto theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/risotto/)'s typography but with a different layout. I named it **Sylvie**.
- I made it look like a program window, which I think is very cool.

## 4.0:
Release date: August 2023.
- I saw my friend using this [rissoto theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/risotto/) and I loved how it looks so I decided to give it a try and I didn't regret it (I modified the theme to as it looks now and named it **Chloe**).

## 2.0 & 3.0:
Release date: i forgor.
- As a beginner, I wanted to practice more with more complexity, so I made **2.0** and **3.0**. I struggled while trying to make it responsive but it worked somehow.
