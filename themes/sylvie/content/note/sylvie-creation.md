> This is a note about the creation of the Sylvie theme.

## The reason
I have been using [risotto](http://risotto.joeroe.io/) theme with custom modifications for over a year now and I love it.

But it has a major flaw: Its width. The width was only <mark>50rem</mark> and it increases the height of the page, which is not good for reading. You will have to scroll a lot to read a long post.

So I thought to myself: "Why not create a new theme with a wider width?"

> And then, ***Sylvie*** was made.

## About Sylvie
***Sylvie*** has a better width size, which is <mark>80rem</mark>.

I did keep the way ***risotto*** renders markdown files and its color scheme.

The biggest difference is its look. I made it looks like a program window, which I think is very cool.

## Future plans
I will continue update the theme and add more features to it.

The old theme will still be available in the [themes folder](https://github.com/itsccao/itsccao.github.io/tree/main/themes), but I will not update it anymore.
