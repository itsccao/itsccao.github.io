## 6.0 (current version):
Release date: July 2025<text class="versions-date"></text>.
- A theme not based on any other theme, I made it from scratch.
- I named it **July** based on the month I made it.
- The goal of this theme is to be a simple & minimal theme with a modern look.

## 5.0:
Release date: April 2025<text class="versions-date"></text>.
- A theme based on [rissoto theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/risotto/)'s typography but with a different layout. I named it **Sylvie**.
- The idea is to make it looks like a program window, with the close button working.

## 4.0:
Release date: August 2023<text class="versions-date"></text>.
- A friend of mine was using this [rissoto theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/risotto/) and I loved how it looks.
- I modified the original theme and named it **Chloe**.

## 2.0 & 3.0:
