## 1.0:
Release date: June 2023.
- This is the first version of my website when I started to learn front-end development. I glad it worked when I saw it online.
- [Go to page](../../.old/1.0/index.html)

## 2.0 & 3.0:
Release date: July 2023.
- As a beginner, I wanted to practice more with more complexity, so I made **2.0** and **3.0**. I struggled while trying to make it responsive but it worked somehow.

## 4.0:
Release date: August 2023.
- I saw my friend using this [rissoto theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/risotto/) and I loved how it looks so I decided to give it a try and I didn't regret it (I modified the theme to as it looks now and named it **Chloe**).

## 5.0 (current version):
Release date: April 2025.
- A theme based on [rissoto theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/risotto/)'s typography but with a different layout. I named it **Sylvie**.
- I made it look like a program window, which I think is very cool.
